  <h2>Artistic Inspirations</h2>
  <p>It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:</p>
  <ul style="padding-left: 0; list-style-type: none;">
    <li>Impressionism</li>
    <li>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="tab">Abstract Expressionism</li>
    <li>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Pop Art</li>
    <li>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
